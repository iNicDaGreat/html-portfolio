<h2>My top 3 Games of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Call of Duty </h3>
<p>Why you ask? Easy im the best darn Sniper in the lobby and thats facts.</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Series </h3>
<p>
Super chill game, with the perfect amount of jump scares and not to much overkill.
</p>
<h3>UFC Undisputed</h3>
<p>You ever had one of those days where you just need to take out some anger? <br />
   A good way is to knocks some heads and get that title belt.
